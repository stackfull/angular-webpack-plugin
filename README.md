Makes webpack aware of AngularJS modules.

## Status

**This project is abandoned!**

It became apparent that the common usage patterns of angular modules were
simply incompatible with file base modules. This plugin *will* work if you are
careful to identify angular modules with files and structure your dependencies
"downwards", but most angular users do it the other way (e.g. declare a module
in one file and add directives etc. to that module from other files). The result
is that this plugin is only useful if you don't depend on common third party
libraries.

For an alternative approach, have a look at https://www.npmjs.com/package/remove-angular-modules-loader

----
It is at the stage now where you can use it to get angular apps webpacked
without needing `require()` in your code, but it does it by trying to map
between angular module names and file names. The conventions for doing this are
various, so it will not fit all cases.

To see it in action, I've [forked the angular-seed project](https://github.com/stackfull/angular-seed)

## Development

Given how complex the problem is, regular test frameworks can't help much. I've
developed a small grunt task to run compile scenarios and check the output. It's
less than ideal and a little fragile. To add new scenarios, create a directory
in test/scenarios containing a webpack.conf.js config file, an `in` and an `out`
directory. The `in` directory will be used as the source and the output will
be compared against `out/bundle.js` (ignoring comments etc.).

To run the scenarios::

    grunt webpackScenario

by default, it won't show what the output was when it doesn't match, so use

    grunt --debug webpackScenario

In addition, karma tests in the `verify` directory check that the output makes
a viable executable using the `karma.conf.js` file.

The default grunt task checks everything.
